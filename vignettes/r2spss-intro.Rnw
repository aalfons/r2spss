The \proglang{R} package \pkg{r2spss} allows to create plots and
\proglang{LaTeX} tables that look like \proglang{SPSS} output for use in
teaching materials.  Rather than copying-and-pasting \proglang{SPSS} output
into documents, \proglang{R} code that mocks up \proglang{SPSS} output can be
integrated directly into dynamic \proglang{LaTeX} documents with tools such
as the \proglang{R} package \pkg{knitr}.  Package \pkg{r2spss} provides
functionality for methods that are typically covered in introductory statistics
courses: descriptive statistics, common hypothesis tests, ANOVA, and linear
regression, as well as boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, and line plots
(including profile plots).

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Many academic programs in the social sciences or economics require to teach
statistics with \proglang{SPSS} \citep{SPSS}.  Preparing teaching materials in
this case typically involves copying-and-pasting \proglang{SPSS} output into
documents or slides, which is cumbersome and prone to errors.  Moreover, this
approach is not scalable for regular updates of the materials, or for
individualizing assignments and exams in order to combat fraud.  On the other
hand, tools such as package \pkg{knitr} \citep{xie15, knitr} for integrating
the statistical computing environment \proglang{R} \citep{R} and the document
preparation system \proglang{LaTeX} \citep[e.g.,][]{LaTeX} make preparing
teaching materials easier, less error-prone, and more scalable.  There are even
specialized tools such as package \pkg{exams} \citep{gruen09, zeileis14, exams}
that allow assignments and exams to be individualized in a scalable manner.
Package \pkg{r2spss} \citep{r2spss} makes it possible to leverage those
developments for creating teaching materials with \proglang{SPSS} output by
mocking up such output with \proglang{R}.


%% -- Manuscript ---------------------------------------------------------------

%% - In principle "as usual" again.
%% - When using equations (e.g., {equation}, {eqnarray}, {align}, etc.
%%   avoid empty lines before and after the equation (which would signal a new
%%   paragraph.
%% - When describing longer chunks of code that are _not_ meant for execution
%%   (e.g., a function synopsis or list of arguments), the environment {Code}
%%   is recommended. Alternatively, a plain {verbatim} can also be used.
%%   (For executed code see the next section.)


%% -- Illustrations ------------------------------------------------------------

%% - Virtually all JSS manuscripts list source code along with the generated
%%   output. The style files provide dedicated environments for this.
%% - In R, the environments {Sinput} and {Soutput} - as produced by Sweave() or
%%   or knitr using the render_sweave() hook - are used (without the need to
%%   load Sweave.sty).
%% - Equivalently, {CodeInput} and {CodeOutput} can be used.
%% - The code input should use "the usual" command prompt in the respective
%%   software system.
%% - For R code, the prompt "R> " should be used with "+  " as the
%%   continuation prompt.
%% - Comments within the code chunks should be avoided - these should be made
%%   within the regular LaTeX text.

We start by loading the package.

library("r2spss")

\subsection[LaTeX requirements and knitr options]%
{\proglang{LaTeX} requirements and \pkg{knitr} options}

Some of the tables produced by \pkg{r2spss} require the \proglang{LaTeX}
package \pkg{amsmath}, hence the following command should be included in the
preamble of your \proglang{LaTeX} document.
\begin{Code}
% somewhere before \begin{document}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\end{Code}

When creating \proglang{LaTeX} tables in \proglang{R} code chunks with
\pkg{knitr}, the output of the chunk should be written directly into the output
document by setting the chunk option \verb+results='asis'+.  For more
information on \pkg{knitr} chunk options, in particular various options for
figures, please see \url{https://yihui.org/knitr/options/}.


\subsection{Example data sets}

The following two data sets from package \pkg{r2spss} will be used to
illustrate its functionality: \code{Eredivisie} and \code{Exams}.  The former
contains information on all football players in the Dutch Eredivisie, the
highest men's football league in the Netherlands, who played at least one match
in the 2013-14 season.  The latter contains grades for an applied statistics
course at Erasmus University Rotterdam for students who took both the regular
exam and the resit.
%
<<results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE>>=
data("Eredivisie")
data("Exams")
@

Among other information, the \code{Eredivisie} data contain the market values
of the football players.  In many examples, we will use the logarithm of the
market values rather that the market values themselves, so we add those to the
data set.
%
<<>>=
Eredivisie$logMarketValue <- log(Eredivisie$MarketValue)
@


\subsection{Descriptive statistics and plots}

Descriptive statistics can be produced with function \code{descriptives()},
for example of the age, minutes played, and logarithm of market value of
football players in the \code{Eredivisie} data.
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
descriptives(Eredivisie, c("Age", "Minutes", "logMarketValue"))
@
\end{center}

Functions \code{histSPSS()} and \code{boxplotSPSS()} can be used to create a
histogram or boxplot, respectively, of a specified variable.
<<>>=
histSPSS(Eredivisie, "logMarketValue")
@
%
<<>>=
boxplotSPSS(Eredivisie, "logMarketValue")
@

A scatterplot or scatterplot matrix can be produced with function
\code{plotSPSS()} by specifying the corresponding variables.
<<>>=
plotSPSS(Eredivisie, c("Age", "logMarketValue"))
@
%
<<>>=
plotSPSS(Eredivisie, c("Age", "Minutes", "logMarketValue"))
@

\subsection{Analyzing one sample}

With the \code{Exams} data, we can perform a one-sample $t$ test on whether the
average grade on the resit exam differs from 5.5, which is the minimum passing
grade in the Netherlands.  For this purpose, we can use function \code{tTest()}
with a single variable as well as the value under the null-hypothesis.
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
tTest(Exams, "Resit", mu = 5.5)
@
\end{center}


\subsection{Analyzing paired observations}

Similarly, we can perform a paired-sample $t$ test on whether the average
grades differ between the regular exam and the resit by supplying the two
corresponding variables to function \code{tTest()}.
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
tTest(Exams, c("Resit", "Regular"))
@
\end{center}

As nonparametric alternatives, we can perform a Wilcoxon signed rank test
with function \code{wilcoxonTest()} or a sign test with function
\code{signTest()}.
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
wilcoxonTest(Exams, c("Regular", "Resit"))
@
\end{center}
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
signTest(Exams, c("Regular", "Resit"))
@
\end{center}

Note that the order of the variables in the nonparametric test is reversed
compared to the paired-sample $t$ test, but all three tests compute the
differences in the form \code{Resit - Regular}.  This behavior is carried over
from \proglang{SPSS}.

To check which of these tests are suitable for the given data, we can for
example use a boxplot.  Function \code{boxplotSPSS()} allows to specify
multiple variables to be plotted.
%
<<>>=
boxplotSPSS(Exams, c("Regular", "Resit"))
@


\subsection{Comparing two groups}

An independent-samples $t$ test can be performed with function \code{tTest()}
by specifying the numeric variable of interest as well as a grouping variable.
As an example, we test whether the average log market values differ between
Dutch and foreign football players.
%
\begin{center}
<<eval=FALSE>>=
tTest(Eredivisie, "logMarketValue", group = "Foreign")
@
\footnotesize
<<echo=FALSE, results="asis">>=
tTest(Eredivisie, "logMarketValue", group = "Foreign")
@
\end{center}

As a nonparametric alternative, we can perform a Wilcoxon rank sum test
with function \code{wilcoxonTest()} in a similar manner.  Note that it is
not necessary to use the logarithms of the market values here, as this test
works with ranks instead of the observed values.
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
wilcoxonTest(Eredivisie, "MarketValue", group = "Foreign")
@
\end{center}

We can again use a boxplot to check whether the $t$ test is  suitable for the
given data, as function \code{boxplotSPSS()} allows to specify a grouping
variable as well.
%
<<>>=
boxplotSPSS(Eredivisie, "logMarketValue", group = "Foreign")
@


\subsection{Comparing multiple groups}

For comparing the means of multiple groups, one-way ANOVA can be performed with
function \code{ANOVA()}.  Here we test whether there are differences among
the average log market values for players on different positions.
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
oneway <- ANOVA(Eredivisie, "logMarketValue", group = "Position")
oneway
@
\end{center}

The \code{plot()} method for the resulting object produces a profile plot.
%
<<>>=
plot(oneway)
@

A nonparametric alternative based on ranks is the Kruskal-Wallis test, which
can be applied with function \code{kruskalTest()}.  It is again not necessary
to use the logarithms of the market values for this test.
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
kruskalTest(Eredivisie, "MarketValue", group = "Position")
@
\end{center}

Similarly, two-way ANOVA can be performed by supplying two grouping variables
to function \code{ANOVA()}.
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
twoway <- ANOVA(Eredivisie, "logMarketValue",
                group = c("Position", "Foreign"))
twoway
@
\end{center}

We can again produce a profile plot with the \code{plot()} method for the
resulting object.  Argument \code{which} can be used to specify which of the
two grouping variables should be used on the $x$-axis of the profile plot.
%
<<fig.width=6, out.width = "0.7\\textwidth">>=
plot(twoway)
@

The \code{plot()} method illustrated in this section calls function
\code{linesSPSS()} to produce the plots.  The latter is more generally
applicable and can also be used, e.g., for plotting time series.


\subsection{Linear regression}

In this section, we compare two regression models to explain the log market
values of football players.  The first model uses only the player's age as a
linear and a squared effect, while the second model adds the remaining contract
length and a dummy variable for foreign players.

We first add the squared values of age to the data set.
%
<<>>=
Eredivisie$AgeSq <- Eredivisie$Age^2
@

We then estimate the regression models with function \code{regression()}.  As
usual in \proglang{R}, we specify the regression models with formulas.
%
\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
regression(logMarketValue ~ Age + AgeSq,
           logMarketValue ~ Age + AgeSq + Contract + Foreign,
           data = Eredivisie)
@
\end{center}

Argument \code{change} can be set to \code{TRUE} in order to include a test
on the change in $R^{2}$ from one model to the next.  If we then only want to
print the corresponding table containing the model summaries, we can use the
argument \code{statistics} of the \code{print()} method.

\begin{center}
<<results="asis">>=
fit <- regression(logMarketValue ~ Age + AgeSq,
                  logMarketValue ~ Age + AgeSq + Contract + Foreign,
                  data = Eredivisie, change = TRUE)
print(fit, statistics = "summary")
@
\end{center}

Of course, the \code{print()} methods for all objects returned by functions
from package \pkg{r2spss} allow to select which tables to print.  See the
respective help files for details.

The \code{plot()} method of the regression results can be used to create a
histogram of the residuals or a scatterplot of the standardized residuals
against the standardized fitted values.  Argument \code{which} can be used
to select between those two plots.  Mimicking \proglang{SPSS} functionality,
the plot is created for the \emph{last} specified model in the call to
\code{regression()}.
%
<<>>=
plot(fit, which = "histogram")
@
%
<<>>=
plot(fit, which = "scatter")
@
