Title: Format R Output to Look Like SPSS
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2021-11-22
Description: Create plots and LaTeX tables that look like SPSS output for use in teaching materials.  Rather than copying-and-pasting SPSS output into documents, R code that mocks up SPSS output can be integrated directly into dynamic LaTeX documents with tools such as knitr.  Functionality includes that are typically covered in introductory statistics classes: descriptive statistics, common hypothesis tests, ANOVA, and linear regression, as well as boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, and line plots (including profile plots).
